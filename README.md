Yonatan's API
* To use this project you will need to download node.js, express.js packages and you will need to setup a mariadb server and simply run the .sql files 
to init the database

* To change the port/ database server ip/ db password etc use the yonaConf.json file

* I used web.postman.co to send the request but any frontend app will be able to do the same just need to adjust this server's ip

To run the server use:
    node main.js
